Step 1: Enable 2-Step Verification

Go to your Google Account: https://myaccount.google.com/security

Scroll to “Signing in to Google”.

Find 2-Step Verification and click “Turn on” (or “Manage” if already on).

Follow the steps:

Add your phone number for verification.

Choose your verification method (SMS or Google Prompt).

Once completed, 2-Step Verification is active.

✅ This is required because Gmail will not allow App Passwords without 2FA.

Step 2: Generate an App Password

After 2FA is enabled, go to App Passwords directly: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords

If prompted, sign in again to verify.

Under “Select app”, choose Mail.

Under “Select device”, choose Other (Custom name).

Give it a name like NextJS Contact Form.

Click Generate.

Google will show a 16-character password (no spaces).

Example: bggczskslcpesyvq

Copy this password — this is your EMAIL_PASS.

Step 3: Add to .env

Create a .env file in your Next.js project:

EMAIL_USER=vyshnavivgowda@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=bggczskslcpesyvq
